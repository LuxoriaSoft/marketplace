## âœ¨ Features
- **AI-Powered Filters**  
  Apply filters like **Brisque (image quality)**, **CLIP (semantic search)**, **Resolution**, and **Sharpness** to automatically evaluate assets.

- **Quality & Ranking**  
  Each filter generates scores you can use to rate, flag, or organize your collection.

- **Non-Destructive Evaluation**  
  Filtering only tags or scores items â€“ your original assets remain unchanged.

- **Forward Sync**  
  Send selected and scored assets forward into other modules (e.g., LuxEditor, LuxExport) with one click.

- **Integrated Ratings & Flags**  
  View and manage ratings, flags, and filter scores in a dedicated side panel.

- **Simple Save & Sync**  
  Persist results for future sessions or sync directly with the workspace.

1. **Import**

   Run AI-driven filters (Brisque, CLIP, Resolution, Sharpness) to evaluate asset quality.

3. **Review Scores**  
   Check **Rating**, **Flags**, and **Scores** in the right-side panel to identify the best candidates.

4. **Forward & Sync**  
   Save results or push filtered selections to downstream modules.
